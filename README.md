### 🌳 Introduction to Arrowhead Mall

Located in Muscogee, Oklahoma, Arrowhead Mall is a fascinating example of a dead mall. The city of Muscogee has a rich history, dating back to the 1830s when it was part of Indian territory. The area was originally inhabited by native tribes such as the Oage and the Catau. The city's name comes from the Muscogee Creek Nation, one of the tribes that resettled in this area.

## 🏙️ History of Muscogee

Muscogee was an administrative center for the Daws Commission, which was responsible for allotting tribal lands to individuals and paving the way for Oklahoma State, which happened in 1907. The arrival of the railroad in the 1870s sparked growth, and by the early 20th century, Muscogee was one of the most prosperous cities in Indian territory, featuring electric street cars, brick paved roads, and a thriving downtown.

## 📈 Population Growth and Decline

The population of Muscogee shot up when statehood happened just before 1910, reaching 40,000 people. However, it has since declined to around 36,000-37,000 today. This decline has had a significant impact on the local economy, including the Arrowhead Mall.

Arrowhead Mall was built in 1987, with an impressive 432,000 square feet of retail space. At the time, the city's population was around 40,000, making the mall a significant development for the area. However, over the years, the mall has experienced a decline in popularity, with many anchor stores closing, including J.C. Penney, Stage, and Sears.

## 📊 Decline of the Mall

The mall's decline can be attributed to various factors, including changes in consumer behavior and the rise of online shopping.
